# fracleaf

A Clojure project to visualize a fractal shape created by iterating an affine transform.

Uses [Neaderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org/) for the affine transform, nextjournal/clerk for notebook functionality, and [tech.viz](https://github.com/techascent/tech.viz) for visualization.

## Usage

Clone the repo and jack-in.
Go to src/fracleaf/core.clj and evaluate (clerk/show! "src/fracleaf/core.clj") to display a notebook page showing the code and output of the leaf visualization. Evaluate (clerk/show! "notebooks/fractalleaf.clj") for a notebook of just the visualization. See src/fracleaf/gensvg.clj to generate svgs.
